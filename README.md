In this scientific project, various techniques for implementing a mixed multinomial logit model using mode choice data are explained. Over the past few decades, the basic multinomial logit (MNL) model has been extensively employed in predictive modeling. However, in many practical situations, the MNL model performs suboptimally due to its restrictive nature. In contrast, the flexibility of the mixed multinomial logit (MXL) model facilitates the overcoming of many limitations inherent to the basic MNL model, although it also introduces challenges related to proper model specification and identification.

One of the earliest successful implementations of the MXL model was executed by Boyd and Mellman (1980, p. 367) in their analysis of the market share of various automobile types with differing attributes, aimed at improving fuel economy. According to Hensher and Greene (2003, p. 133), the MXL model is among the most powerful advanced choice models available within discrete choice modeling. Furthermore, McFadden and Train (2000, pp. 447–448, 458–463) have demonstrated that, with appropriate specification and mixing distributions, the mixed logit model outperforms other discrete choice models in accurately approximating complex utility models.

In this project, we estimate the MXL model using several approaches. Chapter 2 provides an overview of discrete choice models, including the general forms of the MNL and MXL models, the latent class model, random coefficients in the MXL model, error components in the MXL model, and simulation techniques. Chapter 3 discusses the model specifications for the simple MNL model, error structure-based nesting, cross-nesting, alternative-specific variance structured MXL models, the latent class model, and statistical tests for the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA). Chapter 4 presents the estimation results for the discrete choice models, including the simple MNL, error component-based nesting, cross-nesting, alternative-specific variance structured MXL, random parameter-based MXL, and latent class models.
